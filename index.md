## Hi!

Iâ€™m a fifth-year PhD student at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Anca Dragan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/) and [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/). My research is supported by the [Apple Scholars in AI Fellowship](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2023). I'm also a visiting researcher at Meta AI.

I work on building AI agents that can collaborate with humans.

Previously, I worked on research and product at [Lilt](https://lilt.com/research), working on human-in-the-loop machine translation / Copilot for expert translators. I graduated with a double-major in computer science and philosophy from MIT, where I did research on human-inspired AI with the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/), advised by Kelsey Allen and Josh Tenenbaum, and machine learning security as a founding member of [labsix](http://labsix.org/). I also spent a great summer with the [Natural Language Understanding](https://research.google/teams/language/) group at Google Research NY, advised by David Weiss.
