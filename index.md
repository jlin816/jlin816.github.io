# Hi!

Iâ€™m currently a second-year PhD student at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Anca Dragan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/) and [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/).

I'm interested in **building agents that can collaborate and interact with humans, and use language as a medium to do so.** I spend part of my week at [Lilt](https://lilt.com/research), exploring these questions in the context of human-in-the-loop machine translation (based on my experiences there, I recently wrote [an essay](/2020/06/08/rethinking-human-ai-interaction/) about interesting directions for human-in-the-loop ML in industry!)

Previously, I graduated with a double-major in computer science / electrical engineering and philosophy from MIT. There, I did research on human-inspired ML with the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/), advised by Kelsey Allen and Josh Tenenbaum, and adversarial examples / machine learning security as a founding member of [labsix](http://labsix.org/). I also spent a great summer with the [Natural Language Understanding](https://research.google/teams/language/) group at Google Research NY, advised by David Weiss.

I used to be involved with the hackathon community and organized many seasons of HackMIT. I [read stuff](/reads), [take photos](/photo), and [write things](/blog).

If it sounds like we might get along, [let me know](mailto:jessy_lin@berkeley.edu)! ðŸ˜„
