# Hi!

Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student at [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in fall 2020. For the past year, Iâ€™ve been working on product and HCI / ML research at [Lilt](lilt.com), working on human-in-the-loop machine translation.

These days, Iâ€™m interested in building **machine learning systems that work well in the dynamic, interactive settings of the real world** (I recently wrote [an essay](/2020/06/08/rethinking-human-ai-interaction/) about some new directions for human-in-the-loop ML in industry!).

Previously, I graduated with a double-major in computer science / electrical engineering and philosophy from MIT. There, I did research on human-inspired ML / language learning with the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/), advised by Kelsey Allen and Josh Tenenbaum, and adversarial examples / machine learning security as a founding member of [labsix](http://labsix.org/). I also spent a great summer with the [Natural Language Understanding](https://research.google/teams/language/) group at Google Research NY, advised by David Weiss.

I used to be involved with the hackathon community and organized many seasons of HackMIT. I [read stuff](/reads) and [take photos](/photo). Iâ€™m learning more about philosophy of science and economics (particularly market / mechanism design), and getting better at [writing](/blog).

If it sounds like we might get along, [let me know](mailto:lnj@mit.edu)! ðŸ˜„
