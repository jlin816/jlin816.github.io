<p>A lot of the conversation about the future of AI and automation focuses on the utopian/dystopian endgame (“will humans still work when artificial general intelligence can do everything?”), but it seems like there’s a lot more interesting, tractable, and concrete questions to answer about the effects of “narrow,” task-specific AI that looks more or less like what it does today. Industrial robotics, autonomous cars, customer service chatbots, facial recognition, and other applications are beginning to displace humans on small subsets of tasks. Should we be optimistic about labor in the next 10-50 years, when parts of industries will be automated by narrow AI? What early signs of those trends should we be concerned about now?</p>

<p>There’s no controversy that AI adoption will cause short-term job losses. The question is whether automation will have a <em>lasting</em> negative impact on labor. The commonly held view is no: as we reap the benefits of tech-enabled productivity gains, new sectors and jobs will recoup the losses. Just imagine a more efficient future of autonomous vehicles, with new jobs around redesigning cities / infrastructure and more time for otherwise frustrated commuters to work and play. In Mary Meeker’s “<a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/internet-trends-report-2018/">2018 Internet Trends Report</a>,” (a staple of the startup media diet), she echoes this thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Will technology impact jobs this time? Perhaps…but it would be inconsistent with history as…new jobs/services + efficiencies + growth typically created around new technologies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to dig into whether the drivers of our current situation do indeed match historical precedents. “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25684">Automation and New Tasks</a>” (Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo, 2019) clarifies some of these dynamics. In particular they highlight some interesting critical nuances that often seem to be glossed over:</p>

<p><strong>1) It’s important to distinguish between the effects of automation and the effects of new (work) tasks.</strong></p>

<p>New industries have historically followed new technology and automation, often as a direct consequence. The mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century automated agricultural jobs but replaced them with manufacturing ones. The invention of the aircraft ate away at the railroad traffic but recovered them in the aviation industry. Still, it’s wrong to assume that automation <em>necessitates</em> the creation of new tasks. In many of these cases, additional organizational and technological innovation were what made it possible for new industries to flourish and counterbalance the effects of automation.</p>

<p>The analysis in the paper separates the effect of <em>automation</em> from the effect of <em>new tasks</em> on labor demand, making it explicit that automation itself doesn’t necessarily signal the creation of new sectors and tasks for labor. Automation might typically be accompanied by distinct innovations that introduce new tasks, but the cause-and-effect here is less direct than we might usually assume.</p>

<p>Do automation and new tasks actually separate in practice? Recent labor data (see graph below) shows that automation and productivity is increasing, but new tasks aren’t being created at nearly the same rate. It’s not clear to me whether this is simply because we’re still in the early phases of the tech adoption cycle (not enough time for new infrastructure and industries to be built around new tech yet?), but it’s still a deviation from historical trends, which suggests we might be on a different path.</p>
