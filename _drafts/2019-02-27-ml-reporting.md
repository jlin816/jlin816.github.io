# Title

Why is it so hard to inform the public about fields like machine learning? Why is the disparity between what people think AI can do and what AI can actually do so large?

I'm sure some journalistic pieces are deliberately exaggerated for dramatic effect, but I wonder if some of the misunderstanding is due to a fundamental (and reasonable) misunderstanding of how research _works_.
